### based on forgejo

- forgejo is a FOSS fork of gitea
- https://forgejo.org/faq/
   - Why was Forgejo created?
      - In October 2022 the domains and trademark of Gitea were transferred to a for-profit company without knowledge or approval of the community. Despite writing an open letter, the takeover was later confirmed. Forgejo was created as an alternative providing a software forge whose governance further the interest of the general public.
      - Forgejo was initially presented as a “soft-fork” of Gitea, similar to LineageOS, a community led distribution based on Android from Google. It is however better described as a product built on top of Gitea, Git and hundreds of other Free Software projects. Forgejo also has its own documentation, infrastructure, release pipeline, CI infrastructure, distribution channels etc.
